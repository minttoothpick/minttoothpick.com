When Nic and I reunited to play music after a few monthsâ€™ hiatus due to quarantine, we decided to produce a live streamed performance ASAP. It was a fun challenge; we put it together after only a couple of practices. Many thanks to [Mike Andersen](https://www.youtube.com/user/MikeAndersenPiano) for handling the video and streaming logistics, as well as the live mixing. Besides some blown-out and fragmentary phone footage from live shows, Iâ€™d not really had the opportunity to listen, watch, and review one of our performances, so this was enjoyable and enlightening.

We had a great time performing, and this event served as a reminder that deadlines are conducive to last-minute productivity. We plan to produce another show soon, and *hopefully* Beau will be able to join us, reimbuing FurVur with its full cachet of participatory power.

And a shout out to [Sly Grog Lounge](https://slygroglounge.com), our usual Asheville venue. Support them by [buying a face mask or t-shirt at this site](https://slygrog.square.site/). Hereâ€™s hoping that they are able to safely resume operations in some capacity in the near future.

PS ã€œ I donâ€™t know how to download a high-quality version of the video from Facebook, so pardon the 360p.
