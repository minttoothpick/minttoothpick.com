I am currently on an extended relocation in Daphne, Alabama, where I am surrounded by fond and loving family, the heartrending squalls of a teething six-month-old, and a bountiful amount of basil growing in the back yard.

<!-- Although we are mightily disappointed to be missing out on autumn in Asheville this year... -->

Lots of walking around the neighborhood while wearing the baby. 

Haven't had much time for creative pursuits, although I have [unabsenced myself from Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/minttoothpick/).
