This sequence of songs has been sitting around for several months, waiting for me to "finish up the final touches on the mix," which really means "suuure, you know there's no saving this mix, but keep procrastinating on tossing it into the void anyway." So: it totally is what it is, and what it is is something you can listen to and consider. And sorry, but about a third of it is pretty much just noise.
