I'm enjoying *Dose Curves* by harpist Sarah Pagé. The album is one live performance, making its way through a breadth of sound. It touches a lot of my favorite terrain: tapestries of delay, warm organ drone, scrapes of almost-noise. [Give it a listen: the whole thing is on Bandcamp](https://sarahpage.bandcamp.com/album/dose-curves-2), not Spotify.
