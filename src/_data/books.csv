But, knowledge *of* the fact of our preprogrammed illusions is not itself enough to liberate us *from* them. Wright explores some claims such as how meditation can give us insight into a less filtered form of reality, recognizing the danger of essentializing people and their motives, and attempting to develop a more impartial, universal perspective of peoples' actions. He has great hopes for a ""metacognitive revolution"" that could alleviate much of the seemingly ever-deepening entrenchment between people of different ideological vantage points.",,Fred Sanders,

> Perhaps the immutable error of parenthood is that we give our children what we wanted, whether they want it or not. We heal our wounds with the love we wish we'd received, but are often blind to the wounds we inflict.

It's an empathic exploration of the myriad facets of identity, with a focus on parents with exceptional children. How the lenses of disability and identity work together or against each other on a gradient. How difficulty and trauma are dealt with, how meaning or purpose might be constructed. How people see themselves, how society sees them, how they create communities.

> Physicists gain certain insights from understanding energy as a wave, and other insights from understanding it as a particle, and use quantum mechanics to reconcile the information they have gleaned. Similarly, we have to examine *illness* and *identity*, understand that observation will usually happen in one domain or the other, and come up with a syncretic mechanics. We need a vocabulary in which the two concepts are not opposites, but compatible aspects of a condition.
